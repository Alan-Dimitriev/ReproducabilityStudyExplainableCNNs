# Reproduction of `An Explainable CNN Approach for Medical Codes Prediction from Clinical Text'

[Final version of report, detailing replication process and results](Group_21_FINAL_REPORT.pdf)

We attempted to reproduce the methods and results reported in 2021 paper [An Explainable CNN Approach for Medical Codes Prediction from Clinical Text](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12911-021-01615-6) by Hu et al.


To perform the experiments described in the reproducibility paper:

-Ensure that you local access to MIMIC-3 data .csv's is avaiable
-Run all required sections of the preprocessing jupyter notebook (preprocessing.ipynb)
-cac.py contains all our models
-small_cac.sh is our script to execute model training and prediction
